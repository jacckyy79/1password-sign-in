What is 1Password?
------------------

1Password is a leading password manager designed to help users create, store, and autofill strong and unique passwords for all their accounts. It offers encrypted vaults accessible via apps on mobile, desktop, and web browsers. With a single Master Password, you can securely manage your online credentials without remembering each password individually.

Understanding the 1Password Signin Process
------------------------------------------

### Account Credentials

To signin to 1Password, you need three critical credentials:

1. **Email Address**: The email linked to your 1Password account.
2. **Secret Key**: A unique 34-character key provided during account creation, stored in your Emergency Kit.
3. **Master Password**: The password you set that protects your vault.

The Secret Key and Master Password work together to encrypt and decrypt your data locally before syncing, ensuring zero-knowledge security.

### Signing in on Different Platforms

- **Web browser**: Access the 1Password web vault at https://start.1password.com.
- **Mobile apps**: Sign in via the 1Password app on iOS or Android.
- **Desktop apps**: Use the native 1Password client for Windows, macOS, or Linux.

### 1. Sign In on the Web

1. Open your preferred web browser and go to https://start.1password.com.
2. Enter your **email address** and click **Next**.
3. Enter your **Secret Key**.
4. Input your **Master Password**.
5. If you have Two-Factor Authentication enabled, enter the code from your authenticator app.
6. Click **Sign In** to access your vault.

### 2. Sign In on Mobile Apps

4. Complete any required 2FA authentication.
5. Click **Sign In** to access your vault.

Using Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Signin Security
---------------------------------------------------------

To enhance account security, 1Password supports Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs).

- After entering your email, Secret Key, and Master Password, you will be prompted to provide a 6-digit code.
- This code is generated from an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password’s own built-in 2FA generator.
- 2FA drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your Master Password is compromised.

Managing Your Secret Key and Emergency Kit
------------------------------------------

The **Secret Key** is essential for signing in and encrypting your data. It is generated only once and cannot be recovered if lost.

### Emergency Kit

- When creating your account, you are provided with an Emergency Kit PDF containing your Secret Key, email, and setup instructions.
- It is highly recommended to print this kit or save it securely offline.
- If you lose access to your Secret Key, you can retrieve it only from devices where you are currently signed in.

Remember: Never share your Secret Key or Master Password with anyone.

Troubleshooting Common Signin Issues
------------------------------------

### Forgot Master Password

1Password does not store your Master Password, so if you forget it, you cannot recover it through 1Password. However, if you are part of a family or team account, administrators may help with account recovery.

### Lost Secret Key

- Retrieve the Secret Key from a device where you are signed in by navigating to **Settings > Accounts**.
- Use your Emergency Kit if you have it saved.
- Contact 1Password support only if no recovery option exists.

### Two-Factor Authentication Problems

- Ensure the device time is synchronized properly for TOTP codes.
- Use backup codes if available.
- Disable and re-enable 2FA from your account settings if necessary.

Enhancing Signin Experience
---------------------------

### Biometric Unlock

On supported devices, you can enable Face ID, Touch ID, or fingerprint authentication for quicker access after signing in initially.

### AutoFill Integration

1Password can autofill credentials on websites and apps, reducing the need to manually enter login details after signing in.

### Session Management

- Set session timeouts to automatically lock your vault after inactivity.
- Log out remotely from lost or stolen devices for security.

Security Best Practices for Signin
----------------------------------

- Use a long, unique Master Password combining letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Store your Secret Key offline in a secure location.
- Enable Two-Factor Authentication for your 1Password account.
